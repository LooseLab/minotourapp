1. How much space will I require on my system?

    Whilst the application itself is a few hundred megabytes, it stores all the results in the backend database.
    Alongside this, the standard centrifuge index is 8Gb itself. So we recommend at least 300Gb of space if you are using Minotour for full analysis, and not just monitoring.

    If you plan to just use minoTour for monitoring, the size requirements will be dramatically reduced.
